All csv files generated by the program will be store in the program directory by default.

The program was compilated with pyinstaller, so it may be [false positive to your anitvirus](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4633). 
If you are not shure, you can check the source code and use it instead of .exe file.
